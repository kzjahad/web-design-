    //Ans to the question no.2
    //Operators and operands
    console.log('Operator is a symbol that command the system to do a particular operation and operands is that which represents the data of operations. For example, ' +
        'a = 10;' +
        'b = 20;' +
        'console.log(a+b);' +
        'here a and b are the operands, who are presenting 10 and 20. Then a+b is the operations, where the + operations operate the addition of operands.')

    //Ans to the question no.3
    //a) variable
    //Variable is that, which stores the data value
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x);
    // here x is a variable

    //b) declaration of a variable
    let name = 'Kamruzzaman';
    console.log(name);
    //here I declare the variable named as 'name'.

    //c) Initialization of a variable
    let age = '18';
    console.log(age);
    //here I declare the variable named as 'age' and assign the value 18, since it is the first assignment of the 'age' variable, that's why it's called initialization.
    //d) Initialization of a variable
    age = '60';
    console.log(age);
    //here I again assign the value of the 'age' variable. The every upcoming assign with this one will be called as reassign.
